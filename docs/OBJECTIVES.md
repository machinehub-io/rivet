# Objectives

1. S3-Compatible API: Implement a REST API supporting the key S3 operations (e.g., Create/List/Delete Bucket, Put/Get/Delete Object).

2. Scalable Storage Backend: Provide a storage backend (e.g., filesystem or a pluggable storage layer) capable of handling potentially large objects (multi-GB) and high concurrency.

3. MIT Licensing Compliance: Ensure all source code and dependencies are MIT-licensed or compatible with MIT, ensuring no AGPL-derived or GPL-incompatible components are included.

4. Performance & Reliability: Achieve acceptable throughput and latency metrics for common S3 operations and ensure data durability and integrity.

5. Security & Access Control: Implement basic authentication and authorization (e.g., AWS signature v4 compatible) to secure object access.
