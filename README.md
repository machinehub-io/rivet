# Rivet
High-performance S3-compatible object store released under Apache License 2.0, easily deployable to Kubernetes via Helm charts.

## Reasoning
There does not exist, to our knowledge, an open-source (non-AGPL) S3-compatible object storage system. The AGPL is not compatible with commercial work unless you purchase a license from the creator. This makes it difficult for startups and new businesses to create new derivative works without also having to release their source code.

The second reason for this project is to fully vet out an AI agent. The agent will be writing all the code, tests, installation scripts, and verifying all requirements are met. This is a new frontier of software developing software. The S3 protocol is a well-established interface with strict requirements that make it testable for this scenario.
